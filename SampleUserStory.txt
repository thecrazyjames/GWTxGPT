User Story: Email Subscription Management

As a website visitor, I want to be able to subscribe to the website's email list so that I can receive newsletters and stay updated with the latest information.

Description
The website should provide a user-friendly interface for visitors to subscribe to the email list. Users should be able to enter their email address and click a subscribe button to opt-in for receiving newsletters. The system should validate the email address format and handle scenarios such as invalid email addresses, already subscribed email addresses, and unsubscription requests. Subscribed users should receive the newsletters in their email inbox whenever a new newsletter is distributed. The newsletters should include an unsubscribe link to allow users to opt-out of the email list if desired.

Acceptance Criteria
 - A subscribe button is visible on the website for users to initiate the email subscription process.
 - Users can enter their email address in a designated input field before clicking the subscribe button.
 - The system validates the email address format and displays an error message if an invalid email address is entered.
 - If the entered email address is already subscribed, a message is displayed indicating that the email address is already subscribed.
 - Upon successful subscription, the user is added to the email list and starts receiving newsletters.
 - When a newsletter is distributed, all subscribed users receive the newsletter in their email inbox.
 - Each newsletter email includes an unsubscribe link that allows users to opt-out of the email list.
 - Clicking the unsubscribe link removes the user from the email list, and they no longer receive newsletters.
 - Users who have previously unsubscribed can re-subscribe by revisiting the subscription page, entering their email address, and clicking the subscribe button.

Testing Considerations
 - Test the subscription process with valid and invalid email addresses to ensure proper validation and error handling.
 - Verify that users receive a confirmation message upon successful subscription.
 - Test the unsubscription process by clicking the unsubscribe link in a received newsletter and confirming that the user is removed from the email list.
 - Ensure that subscribed users receive the newsletters in their email inbox when a new newsletter is distributed.
 - Test the re-subscription process for users who have previously unsubscribed, ensuring they start receiving newsletters again.
 - Verify that the unsubscribe link is visible and functional in each newsletter email.
 - Test the system's ability to handle a large number of subscriptions and unsubscriptions.
 - Validate that the email list is updated accurately based on user actions (subscription, unsubscription, re-subscription).
 - Ensure that the email content is properly formatted and displays correctly in different email clients.
 - Test the performance and reliability of the email distribution process, especially when sending newsletters to a large number of subscribers.
